# Whoosh - the game

You are a GTA style car cruising through the ghetto, until you find a squeaking guinea pig in the side of the road. What is it doing here, but more importantly. Why does it think it's allowed on MY ROAD?! Among others, your goal will be to find this guinea pig and git rid of it for all. Make the road yours again! Ow and you also might find other drivers along the road, who also think they are allowed here. I don't think I need to mention what to do with them...
